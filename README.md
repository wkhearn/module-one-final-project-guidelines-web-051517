#NBA BOXSCORE FANTASY GAME

Every NBA season, there are 1,230 regular season games and anywhere between 60 and 105 playoff games. In each game, players shoot, score, miss, rebound, and more. That's a lot of stats, and a lot of data to play with! But even the biggest NBA history buff can't remember what happens in every game.

In the NBA Box Score Fantasy Game, you will choose an NBA game from the past and will be given a list of all the players who played in the game. You and your opponent will then draft players onto your fantasy team. While in real life, superstars like Steph Curry and Kevin Durant can't be on the same team (ok, bad example...), in the NBA Boxscore Fantasy Game you can select players from either team.

At the end of the draft, we'll tally up which fantasy team scored the most points and then declare a winner!

The NBA Boxscore Fantasy Game was developed by Kenny Hearn and Larson Laidlaw, students at the Flatiron School.
